    Dole's</font></b></p>
    <p align="center"><b><font size="5" face=
    "Times New Roman">Pro-Growth Plan for America's
    Families<br></font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">America today is competing in
    the most dynamic world economy we have ever seen. Scores of
    countries populated by hundreds of millions of people are
    discarding central planning in favor of free enterprise. New
    markets are opening to American goods and services.
    Entrepreneurs are developing new technologies to create
    products we could have only dimly imagined just a decade ago.
    America stands on the threshold of a breathtaking future, with
    greater opportunities for economic growth and prosperity than
    at any time during our nation's history.<br></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yet, rather than seizing these
    opportunities, the Clinton Administration has taken a "grow
    slow" approach to American economic policy. Clinton
    Administration officials have apparently concluded that the
    current average annual growth rate of 2.4% represents the outer
    limit of America's economic potential. The American people have
    paid a high price for the Clinton Administration's neglect:
    growth is anemic; incomes and wages are stagnant; and workers
    understandably feel more and more anxious about the
    future.<br></font></p>
    <p><b><font face="Times New Roman">In order to create rising
    incomes for all Americans, we must commit ourselves to a far
    more ambitious endeavor. Growth must be <u>the</u> central goal
    of U.S. economic policy. Economic growth--and the rising living
    standards and prosperity it creates for all Americans--should
    be the standard by which all economic policies are judged.
    America can do better if we set ambitious, but reachable,
    growth goals for our country and then implement the policies
    necessary to achieve them.<br></font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Bob Dole believes the
    economy can grow at an annual rate of 3.5%</b>. And he will
    implement a plan to achieve this goal.<br></font></p>
    <p align="center"><b><u><font size="4" face=
    "Times New Roman">The Clinton Record</font></u></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Bill Clinton likes to claim we
    have the strongest economy in a generation. But economic growth
    has been anemic; and, if you accept the Clinton
    Administration's own projections, the economy will struggle
    along at 2.3% growth into the next century. <font size=
    "1">(Source: Dr. J. Stiglitz, White House Press Briefing, July
    18, 1996).</font> Wages and incomes for working Americans are
    stagnant. Families are being squeezed by rising taxes.
    Businesses are choking on government regulation.<br></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>This is the fundamental
    reality of the Clinton economy--high taxes and stagnant
    wages.</b> This is the key to middle-class anxiety. It is why
    people feel they are working harder, but falling further
    behind; why they believe the current generation won't be as
    successful as the last generation; why they believe their
    children will be worse off; why they feel so anxious about
    their economic future.<br></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Clinton Administration has
    accepted the notion that paltry growth is the best we can
    achieve. Under Bill Clinton, we have entered a new era of
    diminished expectations--an era when we are told that we can't
    even match the progress of the past, much less compete with the
    most dynamic economies in the world.<br></font></p>
    <p><b><font face="Times New Roman">The central thesis of the
    Dole growth agenda is that America can do better. The story of
    America has been written by those who have set and achieved
    ambitious goals, not those who impose artificial limits on
    accomplishment.<br></font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The truth is, anemic rates of
    growth and stagnant wages are only inevitable if we continue to
    follow Bill Clinton's economic prescription of higher taxes, a
    refusal to balance the budget, and the over-regulation of the
    economy. <b>The total tax burden is the highest in U.S.
    history</b>. Federal, state, and local taxes consumed a record
    31.3% of GDP last year. At the end of World War II, taxes
    consumed only 25% of GDP. The federal tax burden alone rose
    from 19.2% of GDP in 1992 to 20.5% today. <font size=
    "1">(Source: National Center for Policy Analysis).</font> The
    average middle-income family spends more of its budget to pay
    taxes than it does on food, clothing, and shelter combined.
    <font size="1">(Source: Joint Economic
    Committee)</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">By any historical measure of
    economic growth, America's economy is lagging. Economic growth
    under Bill Clinton has averaged 2.4% per year. That's slower
    than when he was elected in 1992 (3.7%); slower than the entire
    decade of the 1980s (3.2%); slower than the last five
    expansions (4.4%); and slower than what we've averaged over our
    entire post-World War II history (3.3%). <font size=
    "1">(Source: Joint Economic Committee)</font><br></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Productivity growth--the source
    of rising incomes--has been cut in half during the Clinton
    Presidency, falling from 1.2% per year from 1980 to 1992 to
    only 0.6% from 1993 to 1995. <font size="1">(Source: 1996
    Economic Report of the President and the U.S. Department of
    Labor).</font> The hard reality of slow productivity growth is
    stagnant wages and incomes that are squeezing working
    Americans. The average real pay--wages, salaries, and fringe
    benefits--of working Americans has stagnated under Bill
    Clinton. This is the first period of expansion in U.S. history
    when workers' pay has not risen.<br></font></p>
    <p align="center"><b><u><font size="4" face=
    "Times New Roman">SUMMARY</font></u></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One of the central goals of Bob
    Dole's Presidency will be to <b>stimulate greater economic
    growth</b>. The goal is not just to restore America to its
    pre-Clinton rates of economic growth, but to achieve an even
    more ambitious growth path of 3.5% or higher, with price
    stability.<br></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In sum, the six key points of
    Bob Dole's Pro-Growth Plan for America's Families
    are:<br></font></p>

    <p><b><u><font face="Times New Roman">1. A BALANCED BUDGET
    AMENDMENT<br></font></u></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One of the first priorities of
    a Dole Administration will be to secure Congressional passage
    and ratification of the Balanced Budget Amendment to the U.S.
    Constitution. Only the moral authority of the Constitution can
    force Washington to do what every American family must do: live
    within its means. Most states are required to balance their
    books. Bob Dole believes the federal government should be
    required to do so as well.<br></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Only one man stands between the
    Balanced Budget Amendment and the American people--Bill
    Clinton. He has fought every effort to pass the Balanced Budget
    Amendment. Since Bill Clinton first took office, the Amendment
    has come up for a Congressional vote three times. Each time, he
    has led an all-out effort to defeat the Amendment. Six members
    of the President's own party, who had previously supported the
    Balanced Budget Amendment, switched their votes...thanks to
    Bill Clinton's efforts.<br></font></p>
    <p><b><u><font face="Times New Roman">2. BALANCING THE BUDGET
    BY THE YEAR 2002<br></font></u></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Balancing the federal budget is
    essential to increasing economic growth. In 1995, the federal
    government paid over $230 billion in interest on the national
    debt, or over 15% of all federal spending. Nearly 40 cents of
    every dollar the federal government collects in income taxes
    goes to pay interest on the national debt. <font size=
    "1">(Source: The Economic and Budget Outlook: Fiscal Years
    1997-2006, Congressional Budget Office, May
    1996).<br></font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The federal deficit drives up
    interest rates and hits families. It is a "stealth tax" that
    every family with a home, every father and mother with a child
    in college, every young person who buys a car, must pay.
    Balancing the federal budget would cut interest rates by nearly
    2%, and save the typical family:</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">more than $36,000 on an
      average home mortgage;</font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">more than $1,400 on an
      ordinary student loan;</font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">nearly $700 on a typical car
      loan. <font size="1">(Source: Joint Economic
      Committee)</font></font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We simply cannot continue to
    mortgage America's future. If we continue current tax and
    spending policies, future generations will be saddled with an
    effective tax rate of over 80%. <font size="1">(Source: The

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are two main problems
    with our current tax system. The American people are
    over-taxed. And our tax system is too burdensome, too complex,
    and too anti-growth. Bob Dole's Pro-Growth Plan For America's
    Families will address these two problems by:<br></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">First, providing immediate tax
    relief for every American taxpayer. The Dole tax relief plan
    contains the following provisions:<br></font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Personal income tax rates
      will be lowered by 15% in three steps starting in 1997,
      providing tax relief across-the-board and reducing
      disincentives that hold back economic growth.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Maximum capital gains taxes
      on individuals will be lowered to 14% to stimulate saving and
      investment. The capital gains tax rate will be 10.5% for
      those taxpayers in the 15% bracket.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">A $500 credit for every
      child under the age of 18 will be provided to low- and
      middle-income families, along with a new Education Investment
      Account with tax-free earnings for college
      education.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">An expansion of Individual
      Retirement Accounts and the establishment of a spousal IRA to
      remove disincentives to saving and investment. Provide
      tax-free incentives for job training and investing in
      education.</font></li>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Tax relief for every American
    taxpayer is step one. But a Dole Administration will not stop
    there. America's tax code discourages work, saving, and
    investment, encourages tax avoidance, and reduces the rewards
    for entrepreneurship--the true engine of economic growth. The
    complexity of our tax system wastes billions of hours in
    compliance and effort and--worst of all--convinces many
    Americans that the tax system has been hijacked by lawyers,
    accountants, and special interests, which it
    has.<br></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Clinton Administration is
    content with the <i>status quo</i> and has no intention of
    seriously reforming the current tax system. Treasury Secretary
    Robert Rubin recently told the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>:
    "There's nothing in the public domain we have found that's
    better than what we have." (6/7/96) Obviously, a second Clinton
    term promises no relief for taxpayers and no simplification of
    the tax code.<br></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Senator Dole believes that
    restoring America to its full economic potential requires a
    fundamental overhaul of the tax system. He will repeal the
    current tax code and replace it with a new system
    that:<br></font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Treats all Americans fairly
      by ending special-interest loopholes and taxing income at
      lower rates.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Is simple enough so that
      most Americans can file their taxes on a form the size of a
      postcard or not have to file a return at all.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Substantially reduces or
      eliminates the bias against savings and
      investment.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Relieves the tax burden on
      working Americans by allowing for the deductibility of the
      payroll tax.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Protects social
      security.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Requires a supermajority of
      both chambers of Congress to raise income tax
      rates.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This new tax system, which is
    lower, flatter, fairer, simpler and more savings-oriented, will
    provide immediate tax relief to every taxpayer and stimulate
    economic growth now.<br></font></p>
    <p><b><u><font face="Times New Roman">4. ENDING THE IRS AS WE
    KNOW IT<br></font></u></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As the tax code has grown more
    complex and loophole-ridden, the Internal Revenue Service has
    grown more aggressive and more burdensome. The IRS today has
    more enforcement agents than the EPA, OSHA, FDA, and the Drug
    Enforcement Agency combined. <font size="1">(Source: Stephen
    Moore et al, "Ax the Tax,"</font> <u><font size="1">National
    Review</font></u><font size="1">, April 17, 1995).</font> <u>It
    is twice as big as the CIA and five times the size of the
    FBI.</u> <font size="1">(Source: Report of the National
    Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform).</font> The
    instruction booklet for the EZ form is 31 pages long. Taxpayers
    spend $190 billion and 6 billion man-hours each year to comply
    with the tax code. <font size="1">(Source: Joint Economic
    Committee)</font><br></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is simply wrong to have a
    tax system that is so complicated that 58 million taxpayers,
    50% of all taxpayers who file, hire professional tax preparers
    to do their own returns. <font size="1">(Source: Joint
    Committee on Taxation)</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Comprehensive tax reform--with
    dramatic simplification and a postcard return for most
    filers--is clearly the most effective way to end the abusive
    power of the IRS. There are other reforms which could be taken
    as well. <u>A combination of the following reforms would allow
    us to cut the number of IRS bureaucrats by 30% by
    1999</u>.<br></font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Establish a one-year tax
      amnesty period as part of a transition to a new tax system.
      Individuals would be permitted to pay back taxes without
      penalty or interest charges.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Shift the burden of proof in
      IRS audits from the individual to the federal government.
      Americans who are audited are currently presumed guilty until
      they prove themselves innocent. This should be
      reversed.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">End life-style audits
      (except in cases where there is clear evidence of criminal
      activity). A life-style audit is the practice whereby the IRS
      requires taxpayers to document their style of living in
      minute detail to determine whether their reported income is
      sufficient to support that lifestyle. Under this type of
      audit, taxpayers can be questioned about a wide range of
      personal subjects--from how often they go out to dinner, to
      where they spent their summer vacation, to which school their
      children attend.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Eliminate IRS filing for 40
      million low- and middle-income taxpayers. Taxpayers with only
      wage income and less than $250 in investment income would no
      longer be required to file a tax return. All of their taxes
      would be collected through withholding.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Shift IRS personnel and
      resources to the front-end of the tax filing process rather
      than the back-end. IRS employees should be dedicated to
      helping American taxpayers file their returns correctly, not
      simply waiting until they make a mistake and then pouncing on
      them with an audit. The IRS should be on the side of the
      taxpayer--helping individuals comply with the law, not just
      punishing them for being unable to figure out an
      incomprehensible tax system.</font></li>

    <p><b><u><font face="Times New Roman">5. EDUCATION AND JOB
    TRAINING REFORM<br></font></u></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As we enter a new century, it
    is obvious that the opportunities of tomorrow will be created
    in America's classrooms and science labs. Education is the
    single greatest force for improving opportunity from one
    generation to the next. The value of education, training, and
    other human capital is no less important than that of machines
    and other physical capital.<br></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The American people know how to
    build a world-class educational system. We built one once
    before. It rested upon a solid foundation of parents and
    teachers who exercised direct control over grade schools and
    high schools. It rested upon colleges and universities that are
    the envy of the world, but were affordable to all Americans. It
    rested upon working men and women who learned new skills and
    climbed up the economic ladder, for themselves and their
    children.<br></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Today, education has instead
    become a bloated monument to political influence and the
    <i>status quo</i>. All too often, our schools are dangerous and
    demoralizing places. The price tag of a college education has
    risen astronomically in recent decades, beyond the reach of too
    many families. Employers are discouraged by the tax system from
    providing education and job training assistance to their
    employees. A maze of federal job training programs, designed
    with the best of intentions to give more Americans a first or
    second chance, does not teach workers the skills they need for
    the modern workplace.<br></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Bob Dole will help increase
    long-term economic growth and opportunity by encouraging
    choice, quality, and access to education and training--for
    grade school and high school kids, for students in college and
    other post-secondary institutions, for working Americans, and
    for those laid off or unemployed. Bob Dole will:<br></font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Establish a four-year, $3
      billion demonstration program to provide Opportunity
      Scholarships worth at least $1,000 for elementary school
      students and $1,500 for high school students from low- and
      middle-income families, to attend any accredited
      school--public, private, or religious--that chooses to
      participate. The federal funds for the Opportunity
      Scholarships will be matched each year by $3 billion in state
      funds. These scholarships will help give millions of low- and
      middle-income families the financial ability to choose the
      best schools for their children.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Allow low- and middle-income
      parents and students to deduct the interest they pay on
      student loans for post-secondary school
      education.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Allow low- and middle-income
      parents to establish Education Investment Accounts for their
      children up to the age of 18. The $500 per child tax credit
      or other funds may be placed into these accounts, up to a
      limit of $500 per child per year. As with IRAs, accumulated
      earnings on these accounts will be tax-free if funds are left
      in the account for at least five years. Money may be
      withdrawn from these accounts to pay for tuition, fees,
      books, computers, and other expenses at an accredited
      college, university, or other post-secondary institution of
      higher learning.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Allow workers to receive
      tax-free college, graduate, or post-graduate tuition
      assistance from employers, by permanently reinstating Section
      127 of the Internal Revenue Code. Employers should be
      encouraged to provide tax-free educational benefits to their
      employees without the involvement of wasteful government
      bureaucracies. These educational benefits will provide more
      workers with the skills and learning they need to take full
      advantage of the many new opportunities of today's
      economy.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Increase workers' access to
      tax-free job search and placement assistance from their
      employers to find another job or prepare for a new trade or
      business. This proposal will expand the tax-free outplacement
      assistance rule. Under the current rule, employees receive a
      tax break on such assistance <u>only</u> if the assistance is
      to find a similar job and cash payment is not offered as an
      alternative to the assistance. The new rule will allow
      employers to provide assistance on a tax-free basis even if
      a) the assistance helps prepare the employee for a job in a
      new trade or business or helps the employee start his or her
      own business, and/or b) a cash payment is offered as an
      alternative to assistance.</font></li>
      <li>
        <font face="Times New Roman">Consolidate more than 80
        federal job training, vocational education, and adult
        education programs into a single grant to the states. We
        now spend more than $5 billion a year, with no
        accountability, and studies show these programs are not
        helping people. The current system is confusing, redundant,
        ineffective, and expensive. The bottom line is that the
        current federal job training maze does not teach the skills
        workers need for the modern workplace. States must have
        flexibility to experiment with innovative approaches like
        vouchers that workers can use to purchase the training they
        need from private training firms, schools, and community
        colleges.</font>

    REFORM<br></font></u></b></p>
    <p align="center"><b><font face="Times New Roman">Regulatory
    Relief</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Washington rules, Washington
    regulations, and Washington red tape are strangling the
    American economy and lowering its economic growth rate. An
    estimated $1.3 trillion of economic activity is lost each year
    due to government regulations. (<font size="1">Source: Center
    for the Study of American Business).</font> That means fewer
    new jobs and less take-home pay for America's
    families.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">President Clinton's own
    Administration has estimated that the cost of complying with
    federal regulations was at least $668 billion in 1995, a figure
    larger than the entire personal income tax for the same year.
    This is more than $6,000 per household. By the year 2000, these
    figures are expected to rise to almost $721 billion, or $7,000
    per household. In other words, even if no new federal
    regulations are imposed, the "regulatory tax" on each American
    family from regulations already on the books will increase by
    $1,000 over the next four years. (<font size="1">Source: U.S.
    Small Business Administration)</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">President Clinton has opposed
    real regulatory reform. Just look at the facts: He opposed and
    threatened to veto the Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act of
    1995, which would have required cost-benefit and risk
    assessment analysis of new federal regulations. He vetoed
    regulatory reform in late 1995 as part of legislation to
    increase the debt ceiling. His "Reinventing Government" program
    mainly looked at internal agency rules, not those rules that
    burden individuals and private business.<br></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">His Administration has failed
    to enforce the Paperwork Reduction Act, which requires federal
    agencies to set a goal of at least a 10% reduction of the
    paperwork burden. A Government Accounting Office study
    estimates that the Clinton Administration will achieve at most
    a 1% reduction in FY 1996. His Administration even exempted the
    IRS from the Act by a ruling of the OMB. In a June 1996 report
    GAO stated that since 1989, "the IRS's paperwork burden has
    accounted for more than three quarters of the government-wide
    total."<br></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As President, Bob Dole will
    return sanity and common sense to federal regulations. He will
    eliminate the unnecessary rules and regulations, the red tape
    and bureaucracy that come out of Washington. He will free our
    economy to create more jobs and opportunity for all Americans.
    Bob Dole will:<br></font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Require that benefits
      justify the costs for all new major federal regulations,
      using independent peer-review, sound science and risk

      requirement.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Require all new federal
      regulations to be reviewed and re-evaluated every four years.
      Rules that make sense for the problems of today should not
      become set in stone and act as barriers to growth
      tomorrow.</font></li>

      sunsetting task force, co-chaired by the Director of the
      Office of Management and Budget and the head of the Small

      to evaluate all existing federal regulations and recommend
      the elimination of regulations that are out-dated,

    <p align="center"><b><font face="Times New Roman">Common-Sense
    Legal Reform</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Bob Dole understands that the
    American people deserve a legal system that protects the rights
    of the injured and the pocketbooks of consumers from the greed
    and influence of trial lawyers.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Abuse of the legal system
    impedes economic growth and hurts small businesses, limits work
    opportunities for those seeking jobs, and damages the
    competitiveness of American companies. The cost to the American
    people is staggering: by one estimate, lawsuit abuse imposes an
    effective "litigation tax" of $132 billion per year on the U.S.
    economy. <font size="1">(Source: Tillinghast, Nelson, &
    Warren).</font> Lawyers must be made to realize that our
    nation's legal system is designed to make the injured whole,
    not to make trial lawyers rich.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The current system encourages
    lawsuit abuse. Outrageous punitive damage awards--such as the
    $2.7 million one person was originally awarded after spilling
    McDonald's coffee on herself--encourage the "go-for-broke"
    mentality of trial lawyers, and drive up costs for consumers.
    The rule of joint and several liability--under which a
    defendant can be held responsible for 100% of the damages, even
    if he or she is only 1% at fault--gives trial lawyers an
    incentive to sue everyone in sight.<br></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The trial lawyers, one of the
    richest and most powerful special interest lobbies in America,
    have an enormous stake in maintaining the <i>status quo</i>:
    they rake in an astonishing one-third or more of damages
    recovered in tort cases, reducing the amount received by
    injured parties. Consumers are hurt as well: the average
    American family pays an extra $200 per year in insurance
    premiums to make up for phony claims. <font size="1">(Source:
    National Insurance Crime Bureau)</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">President Clinton is clearly
    the trial lawyers' candidate of choice, and for good reason.
    Mr. Clinton has consistently put trial lawyers ahead of
    consumers, workers, and businesses large and small--most
    recently by vetoing both product liability and securities
    litigation reform.<br></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As President, Bob Dole will
    fight for common-sense legal reform that promotes job
    opportunity and economic growth far into the future--and makes
    the power of the trial lawyer lobby a thing of the past. Bob
    Dole will:<br></font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Limit punitive damages to
      $250,000 or three times economic damages, whichever is
      greater, except in cases involving death, serious injury,
      alcohol or drug use, criminal misconduct, or civil rights
      violations. This limit will apply in all civil cases--not
      just product liability cases. Among the many groups this
      reform will protect are volunteer organizations.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Abolish joint and several
      liability for non-economic damages in all civil cases. Each
      actor in a lawsuit should be held liable only for his or her
      fair share of the problem. This reform will help remove the
      incentive of trial lawyers to drag every possible individual
      or business into a lawsuit.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Promote early settlement of
      claims and reduce lawyers' incentives to litigate by allowing
      a defendant to make an "early offer"--within 120 days--to
      compensate a plaintiff for all economic damages, including
      medical costs and lost income. The plaintiff may reject the
      offer and pursue the lawsuit. But in that case, he or she may
      only recover non-economic damages, including punitive
      damages, where there is clear and convincing proof that
      defendant's conduct was caused by intentional or wanton
      misconduct. States will be able to opt out of this
      reform.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Ensure that money recovered
      in settlements goes to those who were injured, not their
      lawyers, by curbing the abuse of contingency fee
      representation. Where a defendant offers an acceptable
      settlement, the plaintiff's lawyer may collect an hourly rate
      but not a contingency fee. If the settlement offer is
      rejected, the plaintiff's lawyer will only be able to collect
      a contingency fee for an amount awarded by a judge or jury
      that exceeds the original offer. States will be able to opt
      out of this reform.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Work to implement a system
      of "auto choice," which would let car owners choose the kind
      of insurance coverage that best suits their needs--either a
      more expensive policy that covers both economic damages and
      pain and suffering, or a cheaper policy that covers economic
      damages only. Any economic damages not covered in the latter
      policy could be recovered from a negligent driver. Damages
      for pain and suffering would be available in cases involving
      gross negligence or alcohol and drug abuse. By one estimate,
      auto choice could reduce an average driver's yearly insurance
      premiums by 29% or $221 per car. States will be able to opt
      out of this reform.</font></li>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">More growth, more opportunity,
    higher wages, less government, lower taxes. <b>Bob Dole's
    Pro-Growth Plan is the right plan for restoring the American
    Dream.<br></b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Each of Bob Dole's initiatives
    will help fuel the economic growth and opportunity that are our
    birthright as a people. Each of these initiatives draws on the
    simple proposition that the American people, not government,
    are the true guardians of our freedom and prosperity. This is
    the vision that inspired our Founding Fathers when they
    declared, with proud courage, that all men "are endowed by
    their Creator with certain inalienable Rights, that among these
    are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness." We must
    believe in the power of freedom. We must believe in ourselves.
    We must once again seize the opportunities before us as America
    enters the 21st century.</font><br></p>
