    America.</b></font></font></p>

    Smaller Government. Stronger and Safer Families</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font size="+1">MORE
    OPPORTUNITIES</font></b><br>
    In the last four years, people have been working longer and
    taking home less. Over the same time, personal bankruptcies and
    the number of people living in poverty have gone up. Bob Dole
    wants Americans to earn more, keep more and do more.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Lower Taxes</b><br>
    The average family today faces the highest level of taxation in
    history - more than $1 of every $3 earned goes to taxes. That
    is wrong. Parents today spend as much time working to pay taxes
    as they spend with their children. Many families are forced to
    have two parents working just to meet the tax burden. As
    chairman of the Senate Finance Committee in 1981, Bob Dole led
    the enactment of the largest tax cut in American history. As
    President, he will pursue a similar pro-growth, pro-family tax
    cut.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Higher Wages</b><br>
    Every year since Bill Clinton has been in office, taxes have
    been higher and family income has been lower than when he got
    elected. We're working harder and taking home less. Bob Dole
    wants Americans to earn more and keep more of what they earn,
    so parents can do more with their families, churches and
    communities.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Better Jobs</b><br>
    When Bill Clinton passed the largest tax increase in history,
    small businesses were hit the hardest. The National Federation
    of Independent Business called the Clinton Administration "the
    most anti-small business administration in history." But small
    business is the engine for job creation in our economy. As a
    result, Clinton's term has spawned a record number of personal
    bankruptcies and lower rates of growth than America has seen in
    21 of the last 30 years.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Choice in Education</b><br>
    All families should have the same right to choose what school
    is best for their children as Bill Clinton who blocks such
    education reform -- and sends his daughter to an exclusive
    private school.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font size="+1">SMALLER
    GOVERNMENT</font></b><br>
    The federal government is taking and wasting too much of our
    money. We must push power, money and influence away from
    Washington and back to the people in their states and
    communities.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>End Wasteful Washington
    Spending</b><br>
    We must end wasteful Washington spending so people don't have
    to pay more in taxes than in food, shelter and clothing
    combined, as the average American family does today.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Balance the Budget</b><br>
    Working Americans will have about $2,000 more per year in their
    pockets from the lower interest rates of a balanced budget. As
    a Senator, Bob Dole ushered a balanced budget through Congress
    and onto Bill Clinton's desk. But Clinton vetoed the first
    balanced budget in 26 years. It's wrong for a country as great
    as ours to impose a staggering debt on our children and
    grandchildren because we are unwilling to break the habit of
    deficit spending today.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font size="+1">STRONGER AND
    SAFER FAMILIES</font></b><br>
    The Clinton Administration has launched an assault on the
    American family. Violent crime is up. Teenage drug use is
    skyrocketing. Welfare recipients are becoming addicted to a
    life of dependency. We must have the courage to choose right
    over wrong to end decades of moral decline.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Fight Drugs and Violent
    Crime</b><br>
    Bill Clinton has slashed drug interdiction efforts, weakened
    enforcement, appointed lenient soft-on-crime judges and joked
    about marijuana use on MTV. Even liberal Rep. Charlie Rangel
    (D-NY) says he has "never, never, never," seen a President who
    cares less about fighting drugs. It should be no surprise that
    drug use is on the rise - after 11 consecutive years of
    decline. Teenage drug use has increased in the past three years
    and teenage marijuana use has doubled on Bill Clinton's
    watch.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Stem Illegal
    Immigration</b><br>
    Under Bill Clinton, expenditures on benefits for illegal
    immigrants has gone up 12.7 percent while wages for the typical
    American worker have fallen 2.5 percent. Welcoming people who
    abide by our laws and contribute to our economy is the American
    way, but rewarding those who are here because they broke our
    laws is the wrong way.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font size="+1">BOB DOLE:
    THE BETTER MAN. FOR A BETTER AMERICA.</font></b><br>
    Bob Dole will lead us to a better America with pro-family,
    pro-growth tax cuts, stepped-up drug interdiction and
    prosecution to reverse the increase in teenage drug use, and
    tougher enforcement of our immigration laws.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Bob Dole doesn't just say
    things to get elected. Even his Democrat colleagues are quick
    to note that Bob Dole is a man of integrity whose word is his
    bond. What he says now is consistent with what he has done in
    the U.S. Senate, where he has supported $2 trillion in tax
    relief for working Americans.</font></p>
