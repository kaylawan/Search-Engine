  <h2 align="center" style='text-align:center'>Where Bob Dole
  Stands on Foreign Policy</h2>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><b><span style=
  'font-size:13.5pt'>A Firm Hand in the Oval Office</span></b><br>
  Our nation needs a President who can articulate and implement a
  consistent foreign policy. The President of the world's only
  superpower must be steadfast in his support of American policies
  and America's friends and allies. The President must mean what he
  says, say what he means, and stick to it. Bill Clinton's
  vacillation and indecisiveness undermines our position at any
  negotiation -- whether on security or trade matters.<br>
  <br>
  <b><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>America Is and Must Remain the
  Leader of the Free World</span></b><br>
  We did not win the Cold War without allies and friends, nor
  should we contemplate facing future challenges without them. At
  the end of the Gulf War, America was respected by friend and foe
  alike. Bill Clinton has squandered this legacy. It must be
  recaptured. America's allies and friends must have their
  confidence in us restored. Potential enemies must know that we
  will stand up to protect our interests.<br>
  <br>
  <b><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Foreign Policy That Puts
  American Interests First</span></b><br>
  The proven principle of "peace through strength" will guide Bob
  Dole's foreign policy. Leadership in support of America's vital
  national interests will be his course of action. Our chief goals
  will be to maintain U.S. economic, political, and military access
  to key regions, promote democratization, thwart the proliferation
  of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems, and
  punish those states and movements that plan or conduct terrorist
  act against American citizens.</p>

    Neither the United Nations, nor any other international
    organization or foreign country, will set America's foreign
    policy agenda. Paring down the U.N. bureaucracy and genuine
    U.N. reform will be a high priority.</li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style=
    'mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; mso-list:l6 level1 lfo18;tab-stops:list .5in'>
    Foreign aid will be offered only as a precise targeted
    instrument of American foreign policy, designed to advance
    specific U.S. foreign policy goals. It will not be an
    international welfare program.</li>

    'mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; mso-list:l6 level1 lfo18;tab-stops:list .5in'>
    The United States must once again lead the North Atlantic
    Alliance. The Dole administration will ensure that the
    enlargement of NATO to include the Central and East European
    democracies will be rapid, with Poland, Hungary, and the Czech
    Republic being admitted by 1998.</li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style=
    'mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; mso-list:l6 level1 lfo18;tab-stops:list .5in'>
    America has a distinct national interest in a firm security
    relationship with a democratic Russia that respects the
    sovereignty and independence of its neighbors. The Dole
    administration will seek cooperation with Russia, but will not
    paper over differences or ignore behavior that is inconsistent
    with Russia's international obligations.</li>

    'mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; mso-list:l6 level1 lfo18;tab-stops:list .5in'>
    American policy toward China will reflect our continuing desire
    to promote economic and political liberalization in that
    country. At the same time, we will not tolerate efforts by
    China to intimidate Taiwan or any other of its neighbors. The
    Dole Administration will be committed to reviving American
    leadership in Asia.</li>

    'mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; mso-list:l6 level1 lfo18;tab-stops:list .5in'>
    In Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bob Dole's main priority will be to
    ensure that the Bosnian people are provided with enough weapons
    and sufficient training to defend themselves against potential
    future aggression. Bob Dole will also promote an approach that
    supports the democratic process in Bosnia and brings indicted
    war criminals to justice.</li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style=
    'mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; mso-list:l6 level1 lfo18;tab-stops:list .5in'>
    America will continue to work closely with our friends and
    allies in the Middle East toward promoting the strengthening of
    democracy and rule of law, the acceleration of economic
    development and the extension of peace. We reaffirm our
    commitment to the territorial integrity of all of the states in
    the region, as well as our special relationship with out
    democratic ally, Israel.</li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style=
    'mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; mso-list:l6 level1 lfo18;tab-stops:list .5in'>
    Only through a policy of relentless pressure on Castro's regime
    can we protect U.S. interests, prompt economic and democratic
    political reform in Cuba, and help the Cuban people. The Dole
    administration will continue to maintain an embargo on Cuba,
    until the Cuban people are free from dictatorship.</li>

  The end of the Cold War closes one chapter in our history and
  presents us with new challenges to consolidate freedom and U.S.
  interests around the world. In also confronts our great nation
  with new dangers. Terrorism is on the rise, both at home and
  abroad. America must have a leader who not only acts decisively
  to prevent terror, but acts swiftly to seek and punish
  perpetrators. Terrorists and those who support them must pay a
  high price for their evil deeds. As we move into the next
  century, we must keep in mind that America has proven that it can
  meet the greatest of challenges and conquer the greatest of
  threats.</p>
