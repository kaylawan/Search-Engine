  <h2 align="center" style='text-align:center'>Where Bob Dole
  Stands on Values</h2>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Bob Dole
  Will Be a Role Model for America's Children</span></b><br>
  The President should be a powerful voice in teaching and
  promoting the values that made America great. Ronald Reagan and
  George Bush both used the Oval Office to address timely social
  and value-related issues ranging from teen drug use to urban
  violence and social decay. They offered visible role models for
  our young people to emulate, and their leadership helped
  strengthen the American family.<br>
  <br>
  As President, Bob Dole will restore that important tradition of
  leadership by example. He will use the bully pulpit of the
  Presidency to speak out on the important moral issues of the
  day.<br>
  <br>
  <b><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Bob Dole Has the Strong Moral
  Character to Lead America into the 21st Century</span></b><br>
  Bob Dole's values are rooted in the small Kansas town in which he
  grew up: love of God and country and family, commitment to
  honesty, decency and personal responsibility, and self-reliance
  tempered by a sense of community.<br>
  <br>
  Those values have guided Bob Dole throughout his life, and they
  will be the foundation on which he bases his Presidency.<br>
  <br>
  It was those values that Bob Dole talked about last year in
  Hollywood when he challenged the entertainment industry to stop
  peddling gratuitous sex and random violence to our children. "Our
  music, movies, television and advertising regularly push the
  limits of decency, bombarding our children with destructive
  messages of casual violence and even more casual sex," Dole said.
  "The mainstreaming of deviancy must come to an end, but it will
  only stop when the leaders of the entertainment industry
  recognize their responsibility."<br>
  <br>
  He took a similar message to Indianapolis a few months later: "We
  must speak out about our values," Dole said, "and insist that our
  culture and our government reflect them. Yes, this means braving
  the ridicule of the cultural elites and speaking out about our
  popular entertainment. Our movies and music, advertising and
  television are having a profound impact on our children. And it's
  not for the good."<br>
  <br>
  Dole's message struck a chord with millions of parents and
  launched a national debate over the impact popular culture has on
  our children. The grassroots movement he started has borne fruit
  in a voluntary television ratings system and this summer's
  educational programming agreement with the major networks.<br>
  <br>
  <b><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>A Better America</span></b><br>
  With Bob Dole as President, America will once again have a
  President who will focus public attention on values -- a role
  model who every parent can point to in teaching their children
  the difference between right and wrong.</p>
