  <h2 align="center" style='text-align:center'>Where Bob Dole
  Stands on Health Care</h2>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><b><span style=
  'font-size:13.5pt'>Bob Dole Favors Common Sense, Free Market
  Health-Care Reforms</span></b><br>
  Losing health insurance coverage or facing obstacles to obtaining
  such coverage is a real concern for many Americans. We need
  insurance reform -- but the answer is not a federal government
  takeover of the health care industry. Bob Dole supports consumer
  choice, open enrollment and portability of medical insurance.<br>
  <br>
  In 1994, Dole introduced a health care reform bill which had no
  price controls, no mandates and no taxes. The bill took on a
  common sense, free market approach to health-care reform,
  focusing primarily on insurance reform, while offering subsidies
  to help low-income Americans buy health insurance.<br>
  <br>
  As President, he will:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li class="MsoNormal" style=
    'mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; mso-list:l3 level1 lfo19;tab-stops:list .5in'>
    Seek ways to make health care more accessible and affordable
    for all Americans.</li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style=
    'mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; mso-list:l3 level1 lfo19;tab-stops:list .5in'>
    Ensure that individuals who change jobs do not lose their
    coverage or face pre-existing condition limitations.</li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style=
    'mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; mso-list:l3 level1 lfo19;tab-stops:list .5in'>
    Give self-employed individuals the same tax deductions that
    large corporations have to buy health insurance.</li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style=
    'mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; mso-list:l3 level1 lfo19;tab-stops:list .5in'>
    Make Medical Savings Accounts a real option available to all
    Americans.</li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style=
    'mso-margin-top-alt:auto;margin-bottom:12.0pt; mso-list:l3 level1 lfo19;tab-stops:list .5in'>
    Support efforts to make community and home based care more
    readily available.<br>
    <br>
    <b><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Medicaid Should Serve
    Low-Income Families in a More Effective Way</span></b><br>
    Medicaid reform is crucial. The states should be given the
    opportunity to redesign their programs without the heavy hand
    of the federal government, so that they can serve low-income
    families and the disabled in a more efficient and effective
    way.<br>
    <br>
    As President, Bob Dole will overhaul the nation's Medicaid
    system by giving greater control to state governments who best
    know the needs of the low-income and disabled populations in
    their state.<br>
    <br>
    <b><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Bob Dole Will Propose
    Innovative Solutions to Address Long-Term Care
    Needs</span></b><br>
    Bob Dole believes that access and funding for long-term care is
    as serious a problem as any before us. As President, Bob Dole
    will:</li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style=
    'mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; mso-list:l3 level1 lfo19;tab-stops:list .5in'>
    Propose a tax deduction for families who care for their elderly
    parents or family members.</li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style=
    'mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; mso-list:l3 level1 lfo19;tab-stops:list .5in'>
    Encourage the development of private long-term care insurance
    and provide government help for those wishing to purchase the
    coverage but unable to afford it.</li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style=
    'mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; mso-list:l3 level1 lfo19;tab-stops:list .5in'>
    Expand the options for long-term care beyond institutional care
    to include home, hospice and community-based care
    alternatives.</li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style=
    'mso-margin-top-alt:auto;margin-bottom:12.0pt; mso-list:l3 level1 lfo19;tab-stops:list .5in'>
    Support efforts to ensure the quality of nursing home care and
    to adequately protect against spousal impoverishment.<br>
    <br>
    <b><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Bob Dole Will Save Medicare
    from Bankruptcy</span></b><br>
    Bob Dole is committed to protecting, improving and
    strengthening Medicare.<br>
    <br>
    Last spring, a study supported by three members of Bill
    Clinton's own Cabinet showed that Medicare will be bankrupt in
    five years. Bob Dole will act now to save Medicare for future
    generations. As President, Bob Dole will:</li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style=
    'mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; mso-list:l3 level1 lfo19;tab-stops:list .5in'>
    Lead the effort to save Medicare from insolvency --
    guaranteeing that Medicare will be available to future
    generations.</li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style=
    'mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; mso-list:l3 level1 lfo19;tab-stops:list .5in'>
    Support giving Medicare beneficiaries the right to choose the
    kind of coverage that best fits their own priorities and needs.
    Bob Dole thinks that they should be given the same kind of
    choices that federal government employees have had for
    years.</li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style=
    'mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; mso-list:l3 level1 lfo19;tab-stops:list .5in'>
    Advocate innovative ideas like Medical Savings Accounts and
    managed care as well as traditional fee-for-service plans.</li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style=
    'mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; mso-list:l3 level1 lfo19;tab-stops:list .5in'>
    Recommend the establishment of a blue-ribbon bipartisan
    advisory commission -- similar to the one he served on in 1983
    that saved Social Security -- to solve the Medicare crisis.<br>
    <br>
    <b><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>A Better
    America</span></b><br>
    As President, Bob Dole will use common sense solutions to
    reform the health care industry. Americans won't fear losing
    their health care benefits when they leave their jobs. States
    will be given the freedom to reform Medicaid. And Americans in
    need of long-term care will have more options.</li>
