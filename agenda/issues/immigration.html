  <h2 align="center" style='text-align:center'>Where Bob Dole
  Stands on Immigration</h2>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><b><span style=
  'font-size:13.5pt'>Nearly 300,000 Illegal Immigrants Drain
  America's Resources</span></b><br>
  Nearly 300,000 illegal aliens enter the United States each year
  -- a flood of undocumented immigrants who sap precious American
  tax dollars and undermine the nation's security.<br>
  <br>
  <b><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Dole Will Strengthen Border
  Patrol and Streamline the Deportations Process</span></b><br>
  America is a nation of immigrants, and Bob Dole believes that
  America must continue to be a land of opportunity for those who
  enter the nation legally, work hard, and sacrifice to achieve a
  better life for themselves and their children.<br>
  <br>
  However, Bob Dole does not believe that immigrants who have
  entered the United States illegally should be entitled to
  government welfare services and other benefits. Bob Dole supports
  strengthening the Border Patrol and streamlining the deportation
  process for illegal aliens.<br>
  <br>
  <b><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Bob Dole Has Been a Leader in
  Fighting Illegal Immigration</span></b><br>
  During Bob Dole's career, he has:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li class="MsoNormal" style=
    'mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; mso-list:l26 level1 lfo20;tab-stops:list .5in'>
    Led the Senate to overwhelmingly pass the Immigration Control
    and Financial Responsibility Act. This legislation increases
    the number of Border Patrol agents, creates additional
    detention centers for illegal immigrants, denies public
    benefits to illegal immigrants, and cracks down on illegal
    aliens who have overstayed their visas. The bill also includes
    an amendment authored by Senator Dole that makes crimes against
    women and children deportable offenses.</li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style=
    'mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; mso-list:l26 level1 lfo20;tab-stops:list .5in'>
    Called for an overhaul of American immigration policy, and has
    played a key role in the passage of immigration reforms in
    1983. These reforms help control the flow of illegal
    immigrants, reduce access to entitlement programs and encourage
    legal immigrants to seek employment immediately after entering
    the United States or face deportation.</li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style=
    'mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; mso-list:l26 level1 lfo20;tab-stops:list .5in'>
    Led the effort to require the federal government to reimburse
    states for the cost of incarcerating illegal aliens in state
    prisons. In 1994, Bob Dole fought to provide the states with
    $350 million in reimbursement money. Unfortunately, Bill
    Clinton helped whittle down the actual amount by more than
    half.<br>
    <br>
    <b><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Bill Clinton and His
    Administration Are Soft on Illegal Immigration</span></b><br>
    Bill Clinton has threatened to veto legislation that allows
    states to decide whether to give government services and
    taxpayer-funded benefits to illegal aliens.<br>
    <br>
    Bill Clinton actually proposed cutting funding for Border
    Patrols in his first budget. Clinton's first proposed budget,
    in 1993, sought to cut Border Patrol staffing by 93 positions.

    <br>
    <b><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>A Better
    America</span></b><br>
    With Bob Dole as President, the American people will not be
    asked to support wasteful government programs that reward
    immigrants who enter the country illegally. Bob Dole will crack
    down on illegal immigration while preserving legal
    immigration.</li>
