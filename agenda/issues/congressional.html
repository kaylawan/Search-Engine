  <h2 align="center" style='text-align:center'>Where Bob Dole
  Stands on Congressional and Campaign Finance Reform</h2>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><b><span style=
  'font-size:13.5pt'>Many Americans Have Lost Confidence in Our
  Elected Representatives</span></b><br>
  Too many Americans have lost faith in our elected leaders. Many
  see their representatives as people who live by separate laws and
  are indebted to the big-money special interests that helped elect
  them.<br>
  <br>
  Bob Dole believes that the American people deserve meaningful
  political and campaign finance reform. Members of Congress must
  be held accountable to their constituents and live under the same
  laws as the American people. And the current system through which
  we finance political campaigns must be fixed.<br>
  <br>
  That's why one of Dole's final acts as a Senator was to introduce
  legislation creating an independent campaign-finance reform
  commission whose recommendations would receive a straight up or
  down vote in Congress.<br>
  <br>
  <b><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Bob Dole Has Fought for
  Meaningful Congressional Reform</span></b><br>
  Bob Dole's record shows a solid commitment to true reform. During
  his career, Bob Dole:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li class="MsoNormal" style=
    'mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; mso-list:l28 level1 lfo5;tab-stops:list .5in'>
    Introduced his first campaign finance reform measures in 1974.
    These measures strengthened reporting and disclosure
    requirements for federal elections.</li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style=
    'mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; mso-list:l28 level1 lfo5;tab-stops:list .5in'>
    Voted more than 30 times against congressional pay
    increases.</li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style=
    'mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; mso-list:l28 level1 lfo5;tab-stops:list .5in'>
    Voted to prohibit members of Congress from receiving
    honoraria.</li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style=
    'mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; mso-list:l28 level1 lfo5;tab-stops:list .5in'>
    Pushed the Congressional Accountability Act through Congress
    which requires members of Congress to live under the same laws
    that apply to everyone else.</li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style=
    'mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; mso-list:l28 level1 lfo5;tab-stops:list .5in'>
    Led the Senate to pass the first comprehensive lobbying reform
    in over 45 years. The bill tightened registration and
    disclosure requirements for lobbyists, without infringing upon
    the ability of Americans to petition their government.</li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style=
    'mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; mso-list:l28 level1 lfo5;tab-stops:list .5in'>
    Led the successful effort last year to amend the Senate's
    ethics rules that sharply restrict the ability of Senators to
    receive gifts.</li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style=
    'mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; mso-list:l28 level1 lfo5;tab-stops:list .5in'>
    Introduced legislation to ban contributions by political action
    committees, restrict fundraising outside a candidate's own
    state, prohibit taxpayer-financed "franked" mass mailings a
    full year before an election, and ban the practice of
    "bundling" contributions. Bob Dole has not sent mass mailings
    for years.</li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style=
    'mso-margin-top-alt:auto;margin-bottom:12.0pt; mso-list:l28 level1 lfo5;tab-stops:list .5in'>
    Introduced legislation to prohibit members of Congress from
    using the "franked" mailing privilege to solicit money.<br>
    <br>
    <b><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>The Dole Administration Will
    Continue to Support Congressional Reform.</span></b><br>
    As President, Bob Dole will:</li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style=
    'mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; mso-list:l28 level1 lfo5;tab-stops:list .5in'>
    Support an Amendment to the Constitution to establish a
    two-term limit for Senators and six-term limit for House
    members.</li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style=
    'mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; mso-list:l28 level1 lfo5;tab-stops:list .5in'>
    Limit the power of special interest groups.</li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style=
    'mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; mso-list:l28 level1 lfo5;tab-stops:list .5in'>
    Push for representatives to be more accountable to their
    constituents.<br>
    <br>
    <b><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Bill Clinton Favors Special
    Interests and Opposes Term Limits</span></b><br>
    While an overwhelming majority of Americans support term
    limits, Bill Clinton has stalled. He has fought against term
    limits and has failed to reduce the influence of special
    interests in Washington.<br>
    <br>
    Even members of his own party have noticed. "The president
    likes special-interest sugar to sprinkle around the country,"
    said Sen. Bill Bradley (D-NJ). "He's doing what it takes to get
    reelected." (The Washington Post, June 14, 1995)<br>
    <br>
    <b><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>A Better
    America</span></b><br>
    With Bob Dole as President, there will be real campaign finance
    reform. Bob Dole will fight for the American people -- not
    special interest groups.</li>
