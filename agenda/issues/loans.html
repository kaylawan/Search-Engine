  <h2 align="center" style='text-align:center'>Where Bob Dole
  Stands on Student Loans</h2>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><b><span style=
  'font-size:13.5pt'>Bob Dole is Committed to Helping All Americans
  Pursue Higher Education</span></b><br>
  Bob Dole knows how important the role of the federal government
  is in ensuring access to and the of higher education. The
  government put Bob Dole through college after he served in World
  War II with the help of the G.I. Bill -- a piece of legislation
  that has allowed hundreds of thousands of former American
  servicemen and women to go to college.<br>
  <br>
  Bob Dole and Jack Kemp believe that it is critical that the
  federal government protect and expand opportunities for all
  Americans to pursue a higher education. That is why a Dole-Kemp
  Administration will be committed to increasing quality, choice
  and accessibility in higher education.<br>
  <br>
  The Dole-Kemp plan for economic growth contains provisions that
  will:<br>
  <br>
  <b><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Create Penalty-Free IRA
  Withdrawals for Higher Education</span></b><br>
  Our tax code is hostile to parents trying to save for a child's
  college education. A Dole-Kemp Administration will reverse this
  and <i>encourage</i> savings. Specifically, under individuals
  would be eligible to withdraw funds from an IRA account to pay
  for tuition or related higher education costs for themselves, a
  child, or a spouse without any penalty.<br>
  <br>
  <b><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Create Education Investment
  Accounts</span></b><br>
  A Dole-Kemp Administration will establish "Education Investment
  Accounts" to give low- and middle-income parents more incentive
  to save for their child's college education. Money can be
  deposited into these accounts and saved tax free, up to a limit
  of $500 per child each year as long as the funds are left in the
  account for at least five years. The money can then be withdrawn
  to pay for tuition, fees, books, computers, and other expenses at
  an accredited college, university, or other post-secondary
  institution.<br>
  <br>
  <b><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Restore the Interest Deduction
  for Student Loans</span></b><br>
  Our tax system should be make it easier for Americans to pursue
  higher education. That is why the Dole-Kemp economic growth plan
  restores a sensible deduction to the tax code that will benefit
  students and their families. Under this provision, low- and
  middle-income individuals who are paying off their student loans
  will be able to deduct the interest paid on qualified student
  loans for five years.<br>
