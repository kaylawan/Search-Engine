  <h2 align="center" style='text-align:center'>Where Bob Dole
  Stands on Tax Cuts</h2>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><b><span style=
  'font-size:13.5pt'>President Clinton's Broken
  Promise</span></b><br>
  Bill Clinton promised a "middle class tax cut" in 1992. But after
  he took office, he broke that promise and imposed the single
  largest tax increase in the history of America -- $265
  billion.<br>
  <br>
  <b><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Bob Dole and Jack Kemp Will Cut
  Tax Rates for All Americans by 15 Percent</span></b><br>
  The Dole-Kemp tax cut will reduce rates by 15 percent
  across-the-board and give an additional $500 per child tax credit
  while balancing the budget by 2002. That means:<br>
  <br>
  <b>A married couple with two children earning $30,000 will save
  $1,272 per year</b><br>
  <b>A married couple with two children earning $50,000 will save
  $1,657 per year.</b><br>
  <b>A married couple with no children earning $50,000 will save
  $779 per year.</b><br>
  <b>A retired couple with no children earning $60,000 will save
  $1,727 per year.</b><br>
  <b>A single taxpayer with no children earning $30,000 will save
  $519 per year.</b><br>
  <br>
  <b><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>A $500 Tax Credit for Working
  Families With Children</span></b><br>
  Under our present tax code, parents in working families have less
  and less time to spend raising their children. In fact,
  government figures show that the average working mother spends
  more time working to pay her taxes than she spends with her child
  each work week. A Dole-Kemp Administration will give families the
  tax relief that they were promised in 1992 and never got.<br>
  <br>
  Under the Dole-Kemp economic growth plan, low- and middle-income
  families will enjoy a $500 per child tax credit. For every child
  under the age of 18, a family will see its tax bill cut by $500.
  That means that a family with four children will see its taxes
  reduced by at least $2,000.<br>
  <br>
  <b><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>A Dole-Kemp Administration Will
  Reduce Taxes for All Americans</span></b><br>
  The Dole-Kemp 15 percent tax cut is simple, fair, and will apply
  to every American, regardless of income. Other tax relief
  provisions of the Dole-Kemp economic growth plan will help
  millions of Americans who are struggling to get by. The $500 per
  child tax credit helps families with young children. The
  deduction for student loan interest helps the parents of college
  age children. Many retired seniors will gain from the rollback of
  the Social Security tax hike imposed by President Clinton. The
  capital gains tax cut stimulate billions of dollars in new
  investment for and create millions of new jobs. Here's a look at
  some of the other tax relief provisions in the Dole-Kemp economic
  growth plan:</p>

  <b><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>A Better America</span></b><br>
  The Dole-Kemp strategy for economy growth will restore money and
  power to the real engine of the American economy -- the American
  people. Their policies will mean higher wages, higher incomes and
  more take-home pay for all Americans. All workers will benefit
  from the greater productivity of the workforce and the increased
  profitability of businesses across America. More Americans will
  be able to save and invest in the future. More take-home pay and
  more savings does not just mean a more secure retirement -- they
  also mean more money for education, medical emergencies and a
  secure retirement.</p>
