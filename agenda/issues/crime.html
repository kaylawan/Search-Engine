  <h2 align="center" style='text-align:center'>Where Bob Dole
  Stands on Crime</h2>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Crime is a
  Growing Epidemic in this Country</span></b><br>
  One of the greatest threats facing our country is the epidemic of
  violence that has already destroyed so many of our communities
  and now threatens every segment of our society. In 1994, the
  American people were victimized by more than 42 million crimes,
  including nearly 11 million violent crimes. According to the FBI,
  a crime is committed every 2 seconds -- and a violent crime every
  17 seconds. But only 1 in 100 violent crimes ends in a jail
  sentence. And once in jail, that criminal will serve only a
  fraction of his or her sentence. The total cost of this mayhem is
  more than $400 billion every year. And youth violence is on the
  rise: many experts predict that juvenile arrests will
  <u>double</u> by the year 2010.<br>
  <br>
  Since Bill Clinton took office, trends in violent crime haven't
  improved. There were 500,000 more crime victims in 1994 than
  there were when Clinton took office. In all there were nearly 10
  million violent crime victimizations in our country in 1995
  alone.<br>

  <b><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Bob Dole's Action Plan to
  Combat Violent Crime</span></b><br>
  Bob Dole and Jack Kemp understand that crime is a national
  problem that cannot be solved by the federal government alone.
  The federal government must work in partnership with state and
  local governments. Bob Dole's five-point Action Plan will serve
  as a blueprint for a new era of federal-state-local cooperation
  in ridding the American social landscape of crime. As President,
  he will:</p>

  safe playing ball in the neighborhood park, and Americans won't
  have to buy a second lock for the front door.</p>
