  Stands on Disabilities</h2>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><b><span style=
  'font-size:13.5pt'>Bob Dole Has Been America's Foremost Advocate
  for the Disabled</span></b><br>
  Bob Dole spent over 39 months recovering from massive injuries
  that he received while leading a platoon of the 10th Mountain
  Division in Italy during World War II. As a result of those
  injuries, Bob Dole has limited use of his right arm -- which is
  why he often carries a pen -- letting folks know that his arm is
  'in use.'<br>
  <br>
  From the moment he was injured, Bob Dole has fought for the
  rights of the disabled. In his first speech on the Senate floor,
  Dole spoke of his vision for people with disabilities - of
  independence, dignity and inclusion - and of his own membership
  in the disabled community. In that speech, he said:</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style=
  'margin-right:.5in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;margin-left:.5in'>
  "Mr. President, my remarks today concern an exceptional group
  which I joined on another April 14 - 24 years ago, during World
  War II. It is a minority group whose existence effects every
  person in our society and the very fiber of our nation . . . As a
  minority, it has always known exclusion - maybe not exclusion
  from the front of the bus, but perhaps from even climbing aboard
  it; maybe not exclusion from pursuing advanced education, but
  perhaps from experiencing any formal education; maybe not
  exclusion from day-to-day life itself, but perhaps from an
  adequate opportunity to develop and contribute to his or her
  fullest capacity."</p>
