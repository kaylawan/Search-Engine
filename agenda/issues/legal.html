  <h2 align="center" style='text-align:center'>Where Bob Dole
  Stands on Legal Reform</h2>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><b><span style=
  'font-size:13.5pt'>Ending Frivolous Lawsuits and Other Abuses of
  the Legal System</span></b><br>
  There are 19 million new lawsuits filed each year -- one for
  every 10 adults. In 1994 alone, lawsuits cost the American
  consumer a staggering $152 billion -- a price tag that exceeds
  the entire federal budget deficit.<br>
  <br>
  All too often, the fear of frivolous lawsuits stifles innovation,
  risk-taking and entrepreneurship in America. Bob Dole understands
  that for America to remain an economic world leader, we must not
  be afraid to experiment and be innovative.<br>
  <br>
  That is why Bob Dole has been a leader in the fight to end
  lawsuit abuse. As he recently explained: "Lawsuit abuse hurts
  consumers by raising the costs of goods and services. It limits
  employment opportunities for those seeking jobs. It hurts the
  competitiveness of U.S. businesses overseas. And, perhaps worst
  of all, it can prevent new, life-saving drugs and medical devices
  from ever reaching the market."<br>
  <br>
  As a Senator, Bob Dole has been an outspoken supporter of legal
  reform. He co-sponsored the Product Liability Reform Bill,
  supported the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
  and introduced legislation to extend legal reform protection to
  non-profit, voluntary and charitable organizations like the
  Little League and Girl Scouts.<br>
  <br>
  <b><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Bill Clinton Vetoed Two Reform
  Bills That Would Have Curbed These Suits</span></b><br>
  Bill Clinton vetoed the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.
  The act aimed to make it easier for courts to dismiss frivolous
  lawsuits that clog up the legal system and hurt America's
  entrepreneurs. But trial lawyers -- many of them large
  contributors to Bill Clinton's re-election -- persuaded Bill
  Clinton to veto the bill. Bob Dole led the Senate in successfully
  overriding Bill Clinton's veto -- a bipartisan vote that proved
  how extreme Bill Clinton's position was.<br>
  <br>
  The act, now law due to Bob Dole's leadership:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li class="MsoNormal" style=
    'mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; mso-list:l19 level1 lfo23;tab-stops:list .5in'>
    Makes it easier for courts to dismiss frivolous securities
    lawsuits.</li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style=
    'mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; mso-list:l19 level1 lfo23;tab-stops:list .5in'>
    Puts control of lawsuits in the hands of the investors -- not
    the trial lawyers.</li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style=
    'mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; mso-list:l19 level1 lfo23;tab-stops:list .5in'>
    Protects corporations from being held liable for making
    forecasts or projections that are accompanied by meaningful
    warnings.<br>
    <br>
    Bill Clinton again took the side of trial lawyers over the
    American citizens when he vetoed the Product Liability Reform
    Bill. The bill would have helped reduce the 19 million lawsuits
    filed each year in America.<br>
    <br>
    As President, Bob Dole will sign the Product Liability Reform
    bill.<br>
    <br>
    Bob Dole believes that the interests of working Americans,
    investors and businesses should come before the interests of
    wealthy trial lawyers. As President, Bob Dole will continue to
    support legal reform.<br>
    <br>
    <b><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>A Better
    America</span></b><br>
    With Bob Dole as President, the spirit of innovation and
    enterprise that made America strong will return. Frivolous and
    abusive lawsuits will no longer sap that spirit by discouraging
    risk-taking and entrepreneurship.</li>
