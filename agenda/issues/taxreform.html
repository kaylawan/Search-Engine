  <h2 align="center" style='text-align:center'>Where Bob Dole
  Stands on Tax Reform</h2>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>The IRS
  Has Grown Too Large and Bureaucratic</span></b><br>
  Our tax system is so complicated that Americans now spend 5.4
  billion hours each year just to comply with it. By comparison, it
  took the same amount of time to build all of the cars, trucks and
  airplanes produced in America last year. It's no wonder when the
  instructions for the easiest tax form our government can produce
  -- the EZ form -- runs 36 pages long.<br>
  <br>
  <b><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Ending the IRS As We Know
  It</span></b><br>
  The Dole-Kemp 15 percent, across-the-board tax cut for America's
  families is a good first step toward reforming our tax code. But
  the long-term goal of serious tax reform must be the overhaul of
  the federal tax code. In achieving that goal, a Dole-Kemp
  Administration will bear in mind these six basic principles:<br>
  <br>
  <b>1. Fairness</b> <i>Restore fairness to our tax laws by ending,
  once and for all, special interest loopholes, and taxing income
  at lower tax rates.</i><br>
  Tax laws should apply equally to all. No loopholes designed for a
  privileged few. No special favors for those with the money to buy
  the influence of tax lobbyists. The Dole-Kemp plan aims to
  restore one basic principle: Tax laws should treat all Americans
  equally. Tax relief should be given to all taxpayers.<br>
  <br>
  <b>2. Simplicity</b> <i>Let taxpayers file with a postcard-sized
  form or not file a return at all.</i><br>
  In all its complexity, our tax code is today unfair in almost
  every way imaginable: Our tax laws are beyond the comprehension
  of most mortals. That's why some 55 million Americans need the
  help of an accountant to file our tax returns. And often even the
  accountants cannot make sense of the tax code. It is also a
  tremendous drag on productivity. But that's the price Americans
  are paying today to meet the demands of a burdensome and
  irrational tax code.<br>
  <br>
  <b>3. Pro-Growth</b> <i>End the bias against savings and
  investment in our tax laws.</i><br>
  Under the current system, income that is used for consumption is
  taxed once, while income that is saved is taxed again and again.
  The Dole-Kemp tax reforms begin the process of reducing the high
  taxes on certain types of income, such as capital gains. In doing
  so, it seeks to stop punishing investment and savings.<br>
  <br>
  <b>4. Helps Workers</b> <i>Relieve the tax burden on working
  Americans by allowing for the deductibility of the payroll
  tax.</i><br>
  Working Americans pay taxes every time they receive a paycheck
  from their employers. Many employees actually pay more in payroll
  taxes than they do in federal income taxes. Bob Dole and Jack
  Kemp want to move toward a system that permits them to deduct the
  payroll tax from their overall tax bill, more money will be
  directed back to the working taxpayer.<br>
  <br>
  <b>5. Protects Social Security</b> <i>Help the elderly and those
  living on fixed incomes.</i><br>
  How did the Clinton tax hike affect them? It raised the tax on
  their benefits even higher, so that 85 percent of the Social
  Security payments government makes are now subject to taxes. This
  was just plain wrong, and our plan will reverse it. The Kemp-Dole
  plan will repeal that tax on elderly Americans.<br>
  <br>
  <b>6. Safeguards Against Tax Hikes</b> <i>Require a 60 percent
  majority vote to raise incoeme tax rates.</i><br>
  Our tax laws have seen <i>31 major changes in just 40 years</i>.
  Such constant changes in tax rates, apart from their unfairness
  to working Americans, are extremely destabilizing to our whole
  economy. Earnings should be put further from government. Raising
  tax rates should not be done according to political whim or the
  shifting balance of power in Washington. It's a serious matter,
  one of the most serious responsibilities government has. It's
  serious enough to require the consent of 60 percent of the
  Congress and not a mere majority.<br>
  <br>
  <b><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>A Better America</span></b><br>
  With Bob Dole as President, Americans won't spend their weekends
  during tax season trying to fill out complicated and confusing
  forms.</p>
