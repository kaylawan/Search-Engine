  <h2 align="center" style='text-align:center'>Where Bob Dole
  Stands on K-12 Education</h2>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><b><span style=
  'font-size:13.5pt'>Americans Are Spending More on Education and
  Getting Less</span></b><br>
  Bob Dole is a strong believer in America's public education
  system. He, his wife and his daughter were educated in public
  schools. But today, too many public schools have been taken over
  by an education monopoly that fails to give our children the
  skills they need to compete in our global economy.<br>
  <br>
  Two out of every three 17-year-olds do not know that World War II
  was fought sometime between 1900 and 1950, according to a study
  by the National Assessment of Educational Progress. The study
  also reports that 20 percent of high school seniors are
  functionally illiterate.<br>
  <br>
  Just throwing money at the problem is not the answer. In the past
  30 years, per-pupil spending on education has doubled, yet
  average SAT scores have dropped over 50 points.<br>
  <br>
  <b><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Bob Dole Will Empower Low- and
  Middle-Income Parents With School Choice</span></b><br>
  As President, Bob Dole will create Opportunity Scholarships for
  Children, a federal, state and local effort to give four million
  low- and middle-income families the ability to select the best
  schools for their children.</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li class="MsoNormal" style=
    'mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; mso-list:l18 level1 lfo16;tab-stops:list .5in'>
    Opportunity Scholarships for Children will be funded annually
    with $2.5 billion in federal funds. Four-year competitive
    grants will be awarded to children from low- and middle-income
    families in up to 15 states, including the District of
    Columbia. States will match the federal contribution.</li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style=
    'mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; mso-list:l18 level1 lfo16;tab-stops:list .5in'>
    Opportunity Scholarships will be at least $1,000 for
    kindergarten and grade school students and at least $1,500 for
    high school students. These scholarships could be larger with
    the added support from non-federal sources.</li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style=
    'mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; mso-list:l18 level1 lfo16;tab-stops:list .5in'>
    Families can use these scholarships to send their children to
    any lawfully operating school -- public, private or religious
    -- that chooses to participate. Scholarship funds will be used
    to pay tuition, school fees and other reasonable expenses.</li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style=
    'mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; mso-list:l18 level1 lfo16;tab-stops:list .5in'>
    This program will help fund scholarships for more than four
    million children -- nearly 10 percent of all children in
    elementary and secondary schools.</li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style=
    'mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; mso-list:l18 level1 lfo16;tab-stops:list .5in'>
    This new $2.5 billion federal commitment to America's children
    is budget neutral and will not increase the federal deficit.
    The funding offsets include reducing the Department of
    Education overhead, bureaucracy and wasteful spending.<br>
    <br>
    <b><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Bill Clinton Fights for His
    Political Supporters -- Not Our Children</span></b><br>
    Bill Clinton's opposes school choice because he puts the
    interests of the educational establishment -- and of his
    party's political contributors -- above the interests of our
    children. Clinton has continually fought school choice because
    he and his Democratic colleagues received $2.2 million from the
    movement's biggest opponent -- the National Education
    Association (NEA) -- during the 1992 campaign. That is 17 times
    more money than they gave to Republicans.<br>
    <br>
    In an address to the NEA before the election, Bill Clinton said
    that if he became President, "you will be my partners. I won't
    [make] education decisions that you're not a part of making. I
    won't forget the people that brought me to the White
    House."<br>
    <br>
    Since then, Bill Clinton has done everything in his power to
    kill the school choice movement. Even when Bob Dole tried to
    pass a modest school-choice bill for the District of Columbia
    to help low-income families send their children to decent
    schools, Bill Clinton opposed it. Meanwhile, he sends his
    daughter to one of the most expensive private schools in
    Washington.<br>
    <br>
    Bill Clinton is on the side of education's providers -- the
    teacher's unions, the bureaucrats and everyone else who wants
    to fight for the status quo. Bob Dole is on the side of
    education consumers -- the parents and the children.<br>
    <br>
    <b><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>A Better
    America</span></b><br>
    In Bob Dole's America, low- and middle-income parents will be
    given a real choice in education so that all American children
    have an equal opportunity to achieve their dreams.</li>
