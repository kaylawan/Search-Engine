  <blockquote>
    <font face="Times New Roman">Thank you, Governor Graves,
    Senator Kassebaum. Good morning friends -- Elizabeth, Robin,
    and I thank you for that tremendous welcome. It's great to be
    in Kansas. Of course, I'm not the first Kansan to say, "there's
    no place like home." But for me, the words have special
    meaning. Wherever I have traveled in this life, I have never
    forgotten where I came from -- or where I go home to.<br>
    <br>
    Whatever lessons I have applied in public life were first
    learned here as a member of the Kansas House of
    Representatives. These days I spend much of my time in another
    capitol. You see many things from atop the hill in Washington
    where I work -- but you can see America from here.<br>
    <br>
    Common sense and uncommon sensitivity: that's the Kansas way.
    It's what made Dwight Eisenhower a great general and a great
    President. And it's what prompted Alf Landon with his unique
    wisdom to say, "there are some intelligent people in
    Washington, but there are more of 'em in Kansas." I hasten to
    add the same applies to forty nine other states.<br>
    <br>
    But then, Kansans have never had to look to Washington, DC for
    a sense of compassion or community. As a young man in a small
    town my parents taught me to put my trust in God, not
    government, and never confuse the two. Something else I
    learned, learned the hard way -- that while self reliance is an
    essential part of the American character, so is the spirit of
    community that reaches out to those wounded in body or
    soul.<br>
    <br>
    When I went off to war it was to defend a community of values
    unique in all the world. I came back sustained by the love and
    generosity of friends and neighbors who renewed my sense of
    life's possibilities. Over the years they have given me
    opportunities for service which I can never hope to repay.<br>
    <br>
    Because they restored my spirit in a time of trial I have
    dedicated myself to restoring the spirit of America. And so
    today, tempered by adversity, seasoned by experience, mindful
    of the world as it is -- yet confident it can be made better --
    I have come home to Kansas with a grateful heart to declare
    that I am a candidate for the Presidency of the United
    States.<br>
    <br>
    The view many Americans see this morning is a sobering one. We
    are troubled about the direction our country is taking. Our
    values are under constant assault from our public and cultural
    institutions. We feel threatened by the random incidents of
    violent crime. Too many of our schools, which were once
    passports to opportunity, have become demoralizing places.
    Welfare has become a misery subsidy fostering illegitimacy and
    generations of dependency. And yet the deficit keeps growing,
    taxes keep increasing, and the government keeps demanding more
    and more authority over our lives.<br>
    <br>
    None of this should come as a surprise. For much of this
    century power and wealth alike have flowed from grassroots
    Americans to a federal government which exploded to meet the
    twin crises of economic depression and global war. Yet, the
    lifejacket of one generation can become the straightjacket of
    the next. In giving to Washington our responsibility to address
    problems close to their source, Americans have unwittingly
    encouraged the Federal government to become too large, too
    remote, too unresponsive, and too undemocratic to be
    representative.<br>
    <br>
    However, another America is waiting -- an America strong again
    in heart and sure of mind. I would like to lead us there.<br>
    <br>
    Our problems are not too difficult to handle. It's just that
    our leaders have grown too isolated from places like Topeka --
    embarrassed by the values here. They seem to have lost the idea
    that we are -- and must remain -- one nation under God. We are
    bound by our heritage to a set of common values: hard work,
    integrity, responsibility -- these values have always been the
    source of our strength and the glue that holds us together.<br>
    <br>
    Our country must again have leaders who believe in our people
    and are proud of our values. We need leaders who will summon
    from each of us the best of our character, who will call us as
    a nation to our full potential. I want to be president so I can
    do this for America.<br>
    <br>
    My mandate as President would be to rein in the Federal
    government in order to set free the spirit of the American
    people; to reconnect our government in Washington with the
    common sense values of our citizens; and to reassert American
    interests wherever and whenever they are challenged around the
    world.<br>
    <br>
    My guide in this would be the final piece of the Bill of Rights
    -- the Tenth Amendment. It reads, "The powers not delegated to
    the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to
    the states, are reserved to the states ... or to the
    people."<br>
    <br>
    When those words were written by our Founding Fathers more than
    200 years ago, they were an affirmation of a radical new theory
    of politics -- a theory based on the need to limit the powers
    of the central government in order to unleash the unlimited
    potential of the people. The Federal government should do only
    those things specifically called for in the Constitution. All
    others should remain with the states or the people. It is a
    philosophy of freedom conceived in liberty, tested by history,
    yet too often ignored in Washington. I intend to restore
    it.<br>
    <br>
    In the last election, the American people sent an unmistakable
    message to Washington. With rare clarity, they reaffirmed their
    faith in themselves and a healthy amount of skepticism about
    government.<br>
    <br>
    If we are truly to rein in government, we must have a President
    who is more than a clever apologist for the status quo. In
    1992, Bill Clinton ran for president as the candidate of
    change. In 1996, he will seek reelection as a candidate pledged
    to prevent change at all cost.<br>
    <br>
    We need a President who will do more than say "no" to every
    spending cut, "no" to every attempt to return power and money
    to the states. We need a President who shares our values,
    embraces our agenda and who will lead the fight for the
    fundamental change America chose last November. We need a
    President who will say "yes" to the American people, and that
    is the kind of President I intend to be.<br>
    <br>
    And while on the subject of creating a government that will say
    "yes" to the American people, let me make one fundamental
    belief crystal clear: we can cut taxes and balance the budget.
    Middle class families are forced to send too much of their
    hard-earned money to Washington. We should provide a tax credit
    for children and remove the marriage penalty to strengthen our
    families. And we should cut the capital gains tax to stimulate
    economic growth, create new jobs, and expand opportunity for
    all our people.<br>
    <br>
    That is just the first step, not the last. We need a president
    committed to making our tax system lower, fairer, flatter,
    simpler -- so that ordinary people like you and me could fill
    out our tax form without a lawyer or an accountant or both.<br>
    <br>
    Balancing the budget will also be a top priority; we cannot
    continue mortgaging our children's future. We will give the
    President the line item veto and we will give the American
    people a Balanced Budget Amendment.<br>
    <br>
    But that is only the beginning. Reining in the government means
    streamlining the entire Federal bureaucracy, getting its nose
    out of places the government just shouldn't be. We should work
    our way through the alphabet soup of government, asking this
    question: Is this program a basic function of limited
    government, or is it an example of how government has lost
    faith in the judgment of our people?<br>
    <br>
    The best place to begin is with four of the most ineffective,
    burdensome and meddlesome departments: Education, Housing and
    Urban Development, Energy, and Commerce. Together they spend
    more than $74 billion per year and employ more than 74,000
    workers.<br>
    <br>
    Let's close down the Education Department and spend the money
    on our children, not bureaucracies and red tape; and let's
    implement school choice to return power to parents. HUD has
    become a cash cow for big city mayors and the well-connected.
    We should give housing vouchers to those who need them and get
    the government out of the landlord business altogether. Energy
    would function better as an agency within the Department of
    Defense. And more than half of what the Department of Commerce
    does has nothing to do with commerce or trade -- duplicated by
    71 other governmental departments, agencies, and offices.<br>
    <br>
    And there are other questions we should ask. We spend hundreds
    of millions of dollars on the Endowments for the Arts and
    Humanities. Why is the Federal government in the culture
    business? In this explosion of the information age, why do we
    have a Corporation for Public Broadcasting?<br>
    <br>
    There are a host of other areas that cry out for reform. I will
    be talking about them at greater length in the year ahead.
    Welfare is one. The Federal system has failed. Why are liberals
    in Washington so afraid to turn welfare decision-making over to
    our governors and state legislatures? There is already
    considerable evidence that they can do much better.<br>
    <br>
    Affirmative action is another Federal policy out of control.
    Discrimination is wrong, immoral. This is America. We should
    have a color blind society. But fighting discrimination should
    never be used to divide Americans by race, ethnic background,
    or gender.<br>
    <br>
    There is one area where the Federal government must work in
    partnership with our state and local governments -- and that
    area is crime. Today, a criminal committing a serious crime has
    less than a ten percent chance of going to jail. And once in
    jail that criminal will serve only a fraction of his
    sentence.<br>
    <br>
    We should put an end to parole for violent offenders. Put
    limits on the endless and often frivolous appeals clogging our
    courts. Remove teenagers who commit serious, violent crimes
    from juvenile courts and try them as adults. We should be more
    concerned with the rights of victims than the privileges of
    criminals. And we must rededicate ourselves to the war on
    drugs.<br>
    <br>
    Finally, let me touch for a moment on America's place in the
    world. There is one responsibility only the Federal government
    has, and that is to protect our freedom. We must never be
    reluctant about our greatness or ashamed of our national
    strength.<br>
    <br>
    We must stop placing the agenda of the United Nations before
    the interests of the United States. When we take our revolution
    to the White House in 1996, we will vow that American policies
    will be determined by us, not by the United Nations. Let us
    remember that America has been the greatest force for good the
    world has ever known.<br>
    <br>
    I was reminded of that on the 50th anniversary of D-Day last
    summer, when the eyes of the world were focused on the beaches
    of France. I was there and witnessed the emotion as memories
    came flooding back -- memories of the heroism, the sacrifices
    and pain men and women suffered.<br>
    <br>
    Before visiting France, I traveled to Northern Italy where I
    served in the 10th Mountain Division. While revisiting the
    battle sites, I thought about why we had been sent there, about
    the America of our youth, the America we were risking our lives
    to protect, and about our hopes for the generations who would
    follow us. And then I thought about the America we live in now
    -- an America still great and still the beacon of freedom
    around the world, but an America that is headed in the wrong
    direction.<br>
    <br>
    Standing there gazing across those peaceful fields I thought of
    why it is critical to have a president who knows what made
    America great, who knows what has been sacrificed to keep us
    free, and who would do all in his power to lead America back to
    her place in the sun.<br>
    <br>
    My friends, I have the experience. I've been tested, tested in
    many ways. I am not afraid to lead, and I know the way. Let us
    rein in our government to set the spirit of the American people
    free. Let us renew our moral convictions and strengthen our
    families by returning to fundamental values. Together, let us
    reassert our rightful place as a great nation.<br>
    <br>
    We should do it for ourselves -- we owe it to our children. We
    must act to be worthy of the gift our ancestors sacrificed so
    much for: to ensure the next century will dawn on a new
    beginning of American greatness ... prosperity ... and freedom.
    Let us do it together. Let us begin today.<br>
    <br>
    Thank you.<br></font>
