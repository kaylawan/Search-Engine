    <blockquote>
      Well, Bob, thank you so very, very much for that wonderful
      introduction and that great welcome to Russell, Kansas for
      Joanne and me. We just happened to be in the neighborhood. To
      those who have heard me speak before, it may be somewhat of a
      disappointment. I understand this is going to be a short Jack
      Kemp speech. I kind of got a feeling it was going to be
      short. At lunch today with Elizabeth and Robin, I turned to
      Bob and I said, "Bob, how long would you like me to speak."
      He said, "Kemp, you can speak as long as you want, but we're
      only going to be here for five more minutes."<br>
      <br>
      Or until it rains, right. It is no secret that I believe this
      is the most exciting time in the most eventful century in
      human history. Here on the eve of the third century, the 21st
      century and the third millennium, American ideals and
      American ideas grip the imagination of men and women in every
      corner of the globe.<br>
      <br>
      In every country in which we travel, you hear the echoes of
      1776, the words of our Declaration of Independence, that all
      men are created equal. The history of our nation has become
      the central feature of the history of the world. There is no
      more challenging nor exhilarating time in history to help
      shape America's leadership and America's future.<br>
      <br>
      And let me say from the bottom of my heart to Bob and
      Elizabeth, to their daughter Robin, with my wife at my side,
      I don't believe there's a higher honor than the one Bob Dole
      has bestowed upon me and my dear family and my wife
      Joanne.<br>
      <br>
      It will be with a keen sense of determination, as well as
      confidence in our ultimate victory, that I accept the
      challenge and the trust of running on Bob Dole's ticket for
      vice president of the United States of America.<br>
      <br>
      It is within our grasp. It is within our grasp to renew
      America's promise, its possibilities, and, most of all, its
      potential. Bob Dole has formally accepted that challenge. He
      has unfurled our banner of growth and opportunity and hope
      and cultural renewal. He has proposed to fundamentally
      reorganize and finally change and reform the way government
      does business. He wants to expand equality of opportunity for
      all our people. That's made the Republican Party the Lincoln
      party. It's now the Lincoln-Reagan-Dole reform party for
      America.<br>
      <br>
      When he proposed major tax cuts - when Bob Dole and his team
      proposed major tax cuts to get America growing again - the
      Clinton White House immediately came out with a million
      reasons why it just couldn't be done. But it forgot the real
      lives of millions of our fellow Americans - parents who lay
      awake at night because they can't pay their taxes or their
      bills; workers in the permanent recession of stagnant wages;
      the children of poverty in America's inner cities who have
      never seen a business open in their life.<br>
      <br>
      They face despair instead of opportunity and a shot at the
      American dream.<br>
      <br>
      Tell them that the status quo is good enough. Tell them we
      can't do better and grow faster. Tell them that inflation is
      caused by too much economic growth. I am especially excited
      about Bob's bold proposal, because our final goal is even
      bolder. This is just the beginning. This is just a down
      payment on true reform, reorganization and renewal.<br>
      <br>
      Bob Dole's vision - Bob's vision - is to start with a blank
      slate, create a fairer, flatter, simpler tax code that will
      carry us into the next century and into unimagined prosperity
      in our children's future. Bob Dole knows it's time to release
      the pent-up and the great potential of human freedom and the
      free men and women of our free society. It's a hopeful
      agenda. It's an inclusive agenda.<br>
      <br>
      And as one that Bob has described, it is not just limited to
      taxes. It extends to welfare and education, crime and drugs,
      breaking the destructive monopoly of federal power, giving
      authority and resources and responsibility to states and
      families. In every area, Republicans today are testing and
      confronting the frontiers of true, ambitious reform. This is
      the place for the people of America who want to reform this
      great nation and our government.<br>
      <br>
      On one side, the Clinton administration seems satisfied with
      a kind of stagnation. On the other side, Bob Dole is pursuing
      the high road begun by Ronald Reagan in 1980, a positive,
      specific agenda of restoring hope, cultural renewal and
      growth. An election should be about, most of all, the big
      things that touch our lives. I can't wait to make that case.
      I can't wait to make that case for Bob Dole in every
      community and every neighborhood of the United States of
      America.<br>
      <br>
      This, above all, is a great nation, and we have a great
      mission and a great cause. The entire world is looking to
      America for inspiration and leadership. More than ever, we
      are the bright signal in an otherwise dark night. And our
      country needs a leader whose stature is equal to that
      calling, and it's Bob Dole.<br>
      <br>
      We need someone who will fight for his principles, who loves
      America, knows what it means to sacrifice for others, to
      sacrifice for his nation, to demonstrate courage under fire,
      a leader who has, throughout his career, brought together men
      and women of all parties and all backgrounds and all colors
      in a common cause. Bob Dole is that man.<br>
      <br>
      Let me close by suggesting that in recent years it has been a
      presidential practice, when delivering a State of the Union
      address, to turn and introduce the heroes in the balcony.
      Next year, when Bob Dole delivers the State of the Union
      address, there will be a hero at the podium.<br>
      <br>
      He'll be able to if you let me finish my speech. Let me take
      a moment to put our opponents on notice. Bob and I are going
      to be asking for the support of every single American, from
      the boroughs of New York to the barrios of California. The
      appeal of growth and opportunity crosses every boundary of
      geography and climate and race.<br>
      <br>
      Reaching these voters, shaking hands and touching hearts, is
      our foremost goal. We may not get every vote, but we're going
      to make it unambiguously clear in word and in our actions
      that we want to and intend to represent the whole American
      family, that no one will be left behind and no one will be
      turned away. That's the Bob Dole mission for America.<br>
      <br>
      One other thought. The great purpose of a great party is not
      to defeat the other party. The purpose of a great party is to
      provide superior leadership and great ideas and to motivate,
      inspire and take this country up, not divide us. Our goal is
      not just to win, but to be worthy of winning.<br>
      <br>
      Bob and I are asking Americans to believe again in the
      promise of the American dream, to reach once more for the
      distant stars. We ask for your hands. We ask for your hearts
      and prayers. We want you to stand by us in this battle. And
      together, with God's help, we can achieve a better life for
      each and every American.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. King said, "I don't know what the future holds, but I do
      know who holds the future." God bless you. God bless America.
