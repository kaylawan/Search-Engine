    Always the truth.</font><br></b><br>
    My husband is a plain-spoken man from the heart of America,
    Russell, Kansas. In Russell, you say what you're going to do
    and you do it. The truth. First. Last. Always the truth. When
    Bob Dole says he'll cut your taxes 15 percent, he'll cut your
    taxes 15 percent. This is Bob Dole. He's a workhorse, not a
    showhorse. And he knows whose money it really is... your
    family's.</p>

    My husband has come out strongly to protect the victims of
    domestic violence, and to make sure a man and woman who work at
    the same job get the same retirement benefits. Bob gets it
    done, not for the credit, but because it's right. And when Bob
    says he'll cut taxes fifteen percent for families, you can
    count on it, because it's right for America. And Bob Dole
    doesn't make promises he can't keep.</p>

    These times demand a real leader.</font></b><br>
    <br>
    His parents instilled values in him, like love of God, love of
    country, love of family, honesty. In an era of too much
    salesmanship and too much smooth talking, Bob Dole is a
    plain-spoken man. It was here that Bob Dole first developed
    strength of character and strong values. I remember in our
    household when you didn't tell the truth my mother she would,
    well she would find a bar of soap. He put aside his dream of
    becoming a doctor and, instead, answered his country's call to
    duty... and was severely wounded. It was about 11 months I
    think before I could feed myself... The fact that I've had a
    problem, a serious problem, and I didn't give up, and I
    overcame it and I was successful. Bob Dole knows what it takes
    to help Americans fight back. You've got to challenge young
    people. They've gotta learn from failure. There is a moral
    crisis in America. Drug use is up. The wrong messages are being
    sent to our youth. Americans do have a stake in this election.
    It's about our America. It's not my America. It's your America.
    It's what do I want for my kids. I want young people to have
    the same challenges and the same opportunities, and succeed as
    I did. And it's about families getting ahead. You shouldn't
    have to apologize for wanting to keep what you earn. It's your
    money.<br>
    <br>
    Bob Dole is the candidate most qualified by virtue of his
    beliefs, his character and competence to be the next President
    of the United States of America. Bob Dole. The only man who
    will restore the American dream.<br>

    Keeping more of what you earn. That's what Bob Dole's tax cut
    plan is all about. The Dole plan starts with a 15% tax cut for
    working Americans.. That's $1,600 more for the typical family.
    A $500 per child tax credit. Education and job training
    incentives... Replacing the IRS with a fairer and simpler tax
    system... And a Balanced Budget Amendment to stop wasteful
    spending.<br>

    deserve better. Dole: Make no mistake about it. My economic
